# Mini-Project for the Udacity Bertelsmann Data Science Challenge 

In this practice project, the pathology dataset includes four columns. Column one contains the cell ID and columns two, three, and four contains the label (Type 1 to 13) specified by three different physicians. 

In the project, we analyze the data to identify:
1. the number of specimens that have disagreements (e.g. where doctors classified the labels differently) and 
2. common patterns among disagreements (e.g specimens that are of Type 1 are typically mislabeled as Type 2)
